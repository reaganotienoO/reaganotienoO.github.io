![Dashboard Screenshot](/assets/projects/health.PNG)  

## Overview
This project analyzes healthcare data to uncover trends in patient demographics, hospital admissions, financial performance, and disease prevalence. The goal is to provide actionable insights for improving patient care, optimizing resources, and reducing costs. The analysis was conducted using Excel for data cleaning and exploration, and Power BI for interactive visualization.

## Objectives
- **Patient Demographics**: Analyze age, gender distribution, and common medical conditions.
- **Hospital Admissions**: Examine trends in admissions, length of stay, and seasonal variations.
- **Financial Performance**: Assess total billing, cost drivers, and high-cost conditions.
- **Disease Prevalence**: Identify common chronic diseases and their impact on healthcare costs.
- **Recommendations**: Develop strategies to optimize patient management and reduce costs.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, standardization, and preliminary analysis.
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard for visualization and deeper insights.

## Key Insights
### Patient Demographics
- **Total Patients**: 55,000 (50.02% Male, 49.98% Female).
- **Age Groups**: Young adults and senior adults dominate the patient population.

### Hospital Admissions
- **Seasonal Trends**: Spikes in admissions during January and July.
- **Length of Stay**: Average of 15 days, with older patients staying longer.

### Financial Performance
- **Total Billing**: \$1 Billion.
- **High-Cost Conditions**: Diabetes and obesity account for nearly \$500M in billing.

### Disease Prevalence
- **Common Conditions**: Diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and arthritis are prevalent, especially among older patients.

## Recommendations
1. **Preventive Care**: Implement targeted health programs for young and senior adults to reduce chronic diseases.
2. **Cost Optimization**: Invest in preventive measures and negotiate better insurance coverage for chronic conditions.
3. **Resource Management**: Increase staffing during peak months and introduce home-based care programs to optimize bed usage.
4. **Data-Driven Strategies**: Use predictive analytics for early intervention and personalized treatment plans.
